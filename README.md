# TAREFA 3.1
###  
• Each student must plan the inclusion of the two new entities sponsors and experts in the platform by carrying out prototyping concepts: wireframes, mockups and prototypes. The information relating to each of the organisations is part of the planning to be carried out, with the decision as to what information is necessary and sufficient resting with the student.

• The files produced should be placed in the individual Git area in a project called task 3.1.

• The application of the wireframe and mockup concepts should have a browser and mobile representation (for drawing the concepts you can use the web application available at draw.io).

• The prototype file for each new entity must already be included on the Administration Page using a document structure based on HTML5. The operation of the back-office component should be tested, with navigation and visualisation of the new entities duly integrated into the various blocks of the web application.
